# SVM-Kernel-Analysis
Comprehensive SVM Kernel Analysis using Iris, Moons, and Synthetic datasets. Includes preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, decision boundary visualization, confusion matrices, performance metrics, and professional plots for educational and analytical purposes.



# Advanced SVM Kernel Analysis Tutorial

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive tutorial and practical implementation of Support Vector Machine (SVM) kernels using Python. The project explores different kernel functions (`linear`, `poly`, `rbf`, `sigmoid`) and their effects on classification performance across multiple datasets, including **Iris**, **Moons**, and synthetic datasets.

The goal is to demonstrate how hyperparameters (`C`, `gamma`, `degree`) and kernel choices influence accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and decision boundaries. This tutorial is designed for educational purposes and provides clear, reproducible examples for students and practitioners.

## Features

* Data preprocessing and standardization
* SVM model training with multiple kernels
* Hyperparameter tuning and optional grid search
* Decision boundary visualization for 2D datasets
* Confusion matrix heatmaps
* Performance metrics table and classification reports
* Accuracy comparison across kernels with professional plots
* Comprehensive notebook with step-by-step explanations

## Installation

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone (https://github.com/ihuk11208-oss/SVM-Kernel-Analysis)
```

2. Install required Python packages:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

3. Open the notebook in Jupyter or any compatible environment:

```bash
jupyter notebook Advanced_SVM_Kernel_Analysis.ipynb
```

## Usage

* Run the notebook cells sequentially to preprocess datasets, train SVM models, visualize results, and generate performance metrics.
* Modify kernel types or hyperparameters to explore model behavior.
* Visualizations provide insights into decision boundaries and classification performance.

## Datasets

* **Iris Dataset**: Classic multi-class dataset for supervised learning.
* **Moons Dataset**: Synthetic 2D dataset suitable for visualizing decision boundaries.
* **Synthetic Dataset**: Generated for demonstrating SVM performance on larger datasets.

No additional dataset files are required; all datasets are generated or loaded programmatically.
